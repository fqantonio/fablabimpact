# Flexible Learning Spaces (FAB LAB) impact on 1st year university students intrinsic motivation

Author: António Carlos Gonçalves, PhD Student, Murcia University

Director: Isabel Solano, Murcia University

# Resume
This research investigates the impact of flexible learning spaces—specifically Fab Labs—on the intrinsic motivation of first-year university students. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the study evaluates levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness within a Design-Based Research (DBR) framework. The analysis is further grounded in constructionist and inductive learning theories to understand how these environments foster student engagement in project development.
